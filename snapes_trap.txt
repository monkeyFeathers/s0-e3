	He pulled open the next door, both of them hardly daring to look at what came next-- but there was nothing very frightening in here. Just a table with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line.
	"Snape's," said Harry, "what do we have to do?" They stepped over the threshold, and immediately a fire sprang up behind them in the doorway. It wasn't an ordinary fire either; it was purple. At the same instant, black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward. They were trapped.
	"Look!" Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles. Harry looked over her shoulders to read it:
	
	Danger lies before you, while safety lies behind,
	Two of us will help you, which ever you would find,
	One among us seven will let you move ahead,
	Another will transport the drinker back instead,
	Two among our number hold only nettle wine,
	Three of us are killers, waiting hidden in line.
	Choose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore,
	To help you in your choice, we give you these clues four:
	First, however slyly the poison tries to hide
	You will always find some on nettle wine's left side;
	Second, different are those that stand at either end,
	But if you would move onward, neither is your friend;
	Third, as you see clearly, all are different size,
	Neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides;
	Fourth, the second left and second on the right,
	Are twins once you taste them, though different at first sight.
	
Now it's up to you to help Harry and Hermione safely navigate the treacherous trap laid by Professor Snape. Using the power of ruby, find the bottle that will allow Harry to move onward to face Voldemort and his destiny, and the bottle that will allow Hermione to move backward to safety. And, since it's only fair for you to know,  the order of sizes from left to right is:
	small, large, smallest, medium-large, medium small, largest, medium
